Simple Quiz Application
// Problem Statem Objective
// Create a "Simple Quiz Application" using JavaScript to reinforce your understanding of
// assignment, logical, and other operators, type conversion, and conditional statements. Your task
// is to build a program that asks the user a series of questions, evaluates their responses, and
// calculates their score. You will use assignment operators to store user inputs and scores, logical
// operators to validate answers, and bitwise operators for an advanced touch. You will practice
// type conversion to ensure the user inputs are correctly handled, using both implicit and explicit
// methods. Finally, you will implement conditional statements to display appropriate messages
// based on the user's score.
// Requirements
// 1. Quiz Questions and Answers:
// ○ Prepare a set of questions and their corresponding answers.
// ○ Use different data types for answers (e.g., number, string).
// 2. User Interaction:
// ○ Prompt the user to answer each question.
// ○ Store the user's responses using assignment operators.
// 3. Score Calculation:
// ○ Evaluate the user's responses using logical operators.
// ○ Increment the score for each correct answer.
// 4. Type Conversion:
// ○ Convert user inputs to the appropriate data types.
// ○ Use both implicit and explicit type conversion methods.
// 5. Advanced Operators:
// ○ Use bitwise operators to demonstrate their application in the quiz.
// 6. Conditional Statements:
// ○ Use conditional statements to display appropriate messages based on the user's
// score.
// Instructions
// 1. Prepare Quiz Questions and Answers:
// ○ Define at least three quiz questions and their answers.
// ○ Ensure the answers cover different data types (e.g., number, string).
// 2. Initialize Score:
// ○ Initialize a variable to store the user's score.
// 3. Ask Questions and Evaluate Responses:

// ○ Prompt the user to answer each question.
// ○ Convert the user's response to the correct data type.
// ○ Compare the user's response with the correct answer.
// ○ Increment the score for each correct answer.
// 4. Calculate and Round the Percentage Score:
// ○ Calculate the user's percentage score based on the total number of questions.
// ○ Use a bitwise OR operator to round down the percentage score.
// 5. Display the Result:
// ○ Prepare a message displaying the number of correct answers, the percentage
// score, and a performance evaluation.
// ○ Use conditional statements to customize the performance evaluation message
// based on the user's score.
